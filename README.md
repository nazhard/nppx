Experimental Nazhard's cute personal javascript package manager

## Goals

- disk safe (doesn't generates node_modules)
- fast (Not too fast, just fast enough)
- simple (not to replace an existing one)
- efficient
- cute

## What's it for?

Basically, NPPX will be one of the cool tools from Nazhard DevToolKit. Yeah, I don't intend to make NPPX more powerful, or even production-ready.

**NPPX IS NOT** for people who are really into JavaScript. NPPX is there, for those of you who want to focus, or try out a JavaScript project without having to sacrifice your disk with the **Big Bang**.

## Status

In a depression phase
